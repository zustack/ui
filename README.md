# Zustack-Based Template

This template is what Zustack uses to speed up development.

It comes preconfigured with React, TypeScript, ShadCN, Tailwind CSS, 
TanStack Query, Axios (with auth config), Zustand (with auth config), custom fonts, 
React Router DOM, and more.

## Clone the repository without Git history
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zustack/ui.git ~/ui
rm -rf ~/ui/.git
```

This will clone the repository into `~/ui` and remove the `.git` directory, 
turning it into a clean project without Git history, perfect for using it 
as a starting template.
